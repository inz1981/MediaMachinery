## Introduction
This project holds information on how to setup a media download, player
and server for contents aiming for TV Series and Movies. With that,
the aim of this project is not to inspire nor encourage to piracy
in any way.

### Hardware
The server and player used for the purpose of downloading and playing
media is an [INTELÂ® NUC KIT NUC6CAYH][NUC] which I found to be perfect
for this purpose. Its small, quite cheap and yet just enough powerful
for the tasks required. I did complement it with a 2.5" SSD disk with a
capacity of 1 TB, as well as a 4GB DDR memory card.
